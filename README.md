# "Inkline Starter Template"

[Link to the TypeScript version of this project](https://github.com/MRSessions/Inkline-Starter-Template-ts)

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite using Inkline UI.

A ~~very underwhelming~~ demo can be found [here](https://green-mushroom-01320b310.2.azurestaticapps.net/)!

## About
I decided to create this template to be able to get up and running with Inkline UI quickly. Inkline was something new that I wanted to try out in a quick side project, and I decided that I wanted a blank starter template to start with.

This should have everything to need to start creating a web app from scratch.

* Pinia is not included
* Using Vue Composition API using `<script setup>`
* Vue Router is installed using a layout template with a header, content, and footer section
* Mobile friendly
* Color mode is based on system with a toggle to change in the navbar
